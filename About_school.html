                <h2>HISTORY</h2>
                <p>Chapter I</p>
                <p>Famy National Integrated High School used to be a small farm place for seedlings and grains, and later on turned into a place of sowing knowledge and growing wisdom.</p>
                <p>Under President Ferdinand Marcos’ regime, Presidential Decree no. 479, s. 1974, that amends the Republic Act 3478, otherwise known as the “Act appropriating the sum of Ten Million Pesos (P10,000,000) as Aid to Provinces in the Maintenance of Provincial High School,” was signed into law on 1962.</p>
                <p>Seven years had passed, 1969, Mr. Nemecio Abary, the principal of Famy Elementary School, together with the District Supervisor Mr. Daniel Acorda; Barangay Captain of Asana, Mr. Hermohenes Vale; elementary teachers and; parents had united to open a new school.</p>
                <p>With an initial number of sixty-four (64) students, the dream of establishing another institution has come into reality. Nevertheless, each learner is required to pay an amount of seven pesos and fifty centavos (P7.50) as their tuition fee, allotted to the teachers’ salary and other school maintenance. Mrs. Ligaya V. Manaig and Ms. Rita F. Advento served as the first educators in the said school. As time passed, new temporary teachers came to further mold the pioneering students. These are Ms. Pita, Ms. Juliet Pangga, Mrs. Alejandra Valsorable, Mr. Pablo Africa, Mr. Rodolfo Halili, and Ms. Elizabeth Laharca.</p>
                <p>Asana Public Barrio High School has been the initial chosen name for the new institution of knowledge because of its location. However, with the desire to introduce the new school to the people, it was named after the town itself, Famy.</p>
                <p>Despite the fact that Famy is just a small and unknown town in Laguna, it did not become a hindrance for their burning desire and later named the school as “Famy Community High School.”</p>
                <p>Corollary to this, another Marcos Type Building was built in the school that served as the home for the knowledge enhancement and skills development of the students. It was also the time when Famineños started accepting and augmenting the foundation of knowledge that led Mr. Marciano R. Vale to be the front-runner and the guidance counselor of Famy Elementary School and later on became the school’s principal. Mr. Vale had been the school head for about eight years, 1970-1978. Under his leadership, the school had brought its first ever recognition as champion in Citizen Army Training Competition held in Sta. Cruz, Laguna, with the help of the adviser Mr. Pablo Africa.</p>
                <p>Before the school year 1978 has ended, Mrs. Elfleda Real became the principal of the school.</p>
                <p>Year 1983, Mrs. Ligaya Manaig served as the Officer-in-Charge of the school while waiting for the new principal. Amid all these, the school activities continued through the joint efforts and undying love of the educators with same purpose—to enhance and educate the youth of Famy.</p>
                <p>From year 1985 to 2013, Mrs. Lourdes served as the mother of the school, raising the standards of education. Under her leadership, many hindrances and challenging experiences came to further strengthen the institution of knowledge. The name Famy Community High School has then turned into Famy National High School on year 1994. Unluckily, the school was not able to celebrate its Silver Founding Anniversary due to Typhoon Katrina on Oct. 19-21, 1994.</p>
                <p>In the year 2014 to 2016, Mr. Solomon Kahulugan became the principal where he further brought the school into the spotlight.</p>

        <div class="card">
                <p>Chapter II</p>
                <p>Under his leadership, they were able to improve the aspects of teaching in different fields that led the school to various recognition in terms of filmmaking, quizbees, scouting, and even in journalism. Mr. Kahulugan was also able to conduct a program that recognizes and appreciates the awards gained by the students.</p>
                <p>With his excellence, Mr. Kahulugan was promoted as the first-ever Secondary District Supervisor. Hence, Dr. Zenaida Yerro, Supervisor in Filipino, served as the temporary principal. In that very year, a huge change has occurred due to the implementation of K-12 curriculum leading to insufficiency of school resources and classrooms. Despite this hindrance, the school employed the shifting of classes where the first shift starts from 5:30 to 12:00 noon and the second shift starts from 12:00 noon to 6:45 in the evening.</p>
                <p>During the time of Dr. Yerro, the implementation of the Senior High School took place in 2016-2017 together with the completion of the required documents in line with the DepEd Order 40, s. 2014, otherwise known as the “Establishment, Merging, Coversion, and Naming/ Renaming Public Schools, and Separation of Public Schools Annexes in Basic Education.” Hence, on the 9th day of November, 2016, Regional Director Dr. Diosdado San Antonio signed the documents taking effect to the renaming of school. From the known Famy National High School into Famy National Integrated High School—still the institution of learning and foundation of successful future of students.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, a four-storey building of 16 classrooms was built in the Campus I through the initiatives of the school heads: Mr. Solomon Kahulugan, who made the proposal that was supported by OIC Principal Dr. Zenaida Yerro, and Mr. Christopher G. Adofina, who complied all the necessary documents for the said project. Aside from these remarkable people, the school was able to purchase the lot through the combined efforts of the faculty and staff and the generous Mr. Henry Alisen. The new home was made possible after the acquisition of the 426 sq.m. lot that served as the new home for the 237 senior high school students in Academic and TVL Tracks.</p>
                <p>After the retirement of Dr. Yerro, Mr. Christopher Adofina served as the Officer-in-charge, the head teacher of Science Department and Senior High School Coordinator. He initiated the school and organized the primary documents of the students such as NSO/PSA, Form 137, class record, and other papers.</p>
                <p>Then after, April 24, 2017 until today, Dr. Milagros B. Puon served as the new principal of the school. In her time, the harmony of the students and teachers was given emphasis and open up the school to external stakeholders resulting to more enhanced and uplift the faculty qualifications and school administration. Hence, the school has been more active to different competitions causing for various victories and student triumphs in different fields.</p>
                <p>Aside from these improvements on structural organization, the school was also able to enhance its physical environment such as facilities wherein few buildings constructed and the covered court’s ground in Campus II was tiled.</p>
                <p>The current principal also managed to organize the schedule of classes despite the inadequacy of classrooms together with the joint efforts of the parents and the teachers; hence, the shifting of classes was removed. Moreover, the security and safety were boosted through the installation of CCTV that resulted to greater satisfaction of the student to the school environment.</p>
                <p>Famy Elementary School recently shared the 1,921 sq.m. lot formally that will serve as the home for the incoming generations of learners. This place will be allotted to the establishment of the planned four-storey building with eight classrooms in Campus I.</p>
                <p>Due to the arising number of students, the school currently exerts its best effort to provide another lot in Campus II that will serve as the place for new building for the betterment of the teaching environment.</p>
